# SFIDE Fire Map
This website was created to allow the scientific and general community to view live or historical thermal anomalies detected by applying the **Satellite Fire Detection (SFIDE)** algorithm to high temporal frequency images obtained from geostationary satellites. The main target satellites are (at the moment) Meteosat Third Generation (MTG-I1) and Meteosat Second Generation's Rapid Scan Service (MSG-11, MSG-RSS). The images are obtained via the EUMETCast Europe system in the facilities of the School of Aerospace Engineering of Sapienza Univerisity of Rome, in Via Salaria.
MTG currently provides thermal imagery at 1 km resolution every 10 minutes, while its predecessor MSG, with its SEVIRI instrument, provides imagery at 3 km resolution but at a temporal frequency of 5 minutes (limited to the top third of the Earth Disc).

Additional data sources (planned, coming soon hopefully):
- MSG-HRIT (MSG-10)
- MSG-IODC (MSG-9)
- MTG-I2 (Rapid Scan Service, will provide imagery every 2.5 minutes for the top quarter of the Earth disc)

As a demonstration, we only process meteosat imagery over Italy.
